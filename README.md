 # BASHRPG

Basically it's a RPG turn per turn, where you'll fight monsters , find loots inside chests or go to the town to sell / buy items
You'll be able to level up to increase your stats and maybe later be able to cast spells.
Maybe i'll adjust the game a little bit , i don't know yet if it's too hard or too easy but it can be very repetitiv.
All monster stats are generated randomly based on your stats.

## Getting Started

You'll need : 
linux OS or some ways to run a shell script and Github installed.

### Prerequisites

If you are using a VM, set the performance to the max you can.
Then give the current window/terminal the biggest ratio.

### Installing

Copy the directory :
```
git clone https://github.com/Quentin90/BASHRPG/
cd BASHRPG/
```
And then start the game :
```
./Jeu.sh
(or bash Jeu.sh/sh Jeu.sh)
```

## Running the tests
All the data for your characters will be stored inside the files called : stats and inventory.
Feel free to edit those to run some tests, don't forget to say 'No' when startinga new game so it don't erase your changes.

 ## More about the game
 
 You'll travel inside "rooms" in which you'll be able to fight/rest/buy equipement based on the role of the room. 
 The main goal of the game is to survive and get better items.
 
 Otherwise everything is pretty standard;
 Probabilities : Fight 60%/ Chest 10%/ Town 30%/
